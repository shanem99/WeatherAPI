# WeatherAPI
API to server weather data built on FastAPI. This is built to be a 2 hour coding challenge presented by Ocula 


## Task

Build an API that will get data from a weather API and return the minimum, maximum, average
temperature, and humidity for a given city and day.


## Requirements

- RESTful API to serve weather data (ideally Python / Fastapi)

- Create a GET endpoint to return the minimum, maximum, average temperature, and humidity
for a given city and day from the open weather api
o http://openweathermap.org/api

- Create an API test to verify the minimum, maximum, and average temperature from the
created RESTful API

- Use git for version control and publish on GitHub

- Unit tests (ideally using pytest)

- Create a local database (e.g. sqlite / postgres) and cache the weather API into a weather
table to avoid duplicate weather API calls

- Use Docker

- Use CI/CD

- Deploy this API

- Use infra as code
